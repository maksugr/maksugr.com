A **system** is the entire set of components, both computer related, and non-computer related, that provides a service to a user. For instance, an automobile is a system composed of many hundreds of components, some of which are likely to be computer subsystems running software.

**Systems** are developed to satisfy a set of *requirements* that meet a *need*. A requirement that
is important in some systems is that they be highly [dependable](/notes/dependable-system). Fault tolerance is a means of achieving dependability.
