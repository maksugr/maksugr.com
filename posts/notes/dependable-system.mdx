## Definition

A system is **dependable** when it is trustworthy enough that reliance can be placed on the service that it delivers. For a system to be dependable, it must be:

* [available](#available) (ready for use when we need it)
* [reliable](#reliable) (able to provide continuity of service while we are using it)
* [safe](#safe) (does not have a catastrophic consequence on the environment)
* [secure](#secure) (able to preserve confidentiality)

Although these system [attributes](#attributes) can be considered in isolation, in fact they are **interdependent**. For instance, a system that is not reliable is also not available (at least when it is not operating correctly). A secure system that doesn't allow an authorized access is also not available. An unreliable system to control nuclear reactors is probably not a safe one either.

## Attributes

### Available

### Reliable

### Safe

### Secure

## Approaches

Achieving the goal of dependability requires effort at all phases of a system's development. Steps must be taken at:

* design time ([fault avoidance techniques](#fault-avoidance))
* implementation time ([fault removal techniques](#fault-removal))
* execution time ([fault tolerance techniques](#fault-tolerance), [fault evasion techniques](#fault-evasion))

### Fault Avoidance

Fault avoidance uses various tools and techniques to design the system in such a manner that the introduction of faults is minimized. A **fault avoided** is one that does not have to be dealt with at a later time. Techniques:

* design
* verification
* validation
* modelling
* code inspections

### Fault Removal

Fault removal uses:

* verification
* testing

techniques to locate faults enabling the necessary changes to be made to the system. The range of techniques used for fault removal includes:

* [unit testing](/notes/testing#unit)
* [integration testing](/notes/testing#integration)
* [regression testing](/notes/testing#regression)
* [back-to-back testing](/notes/testing#back-to-back)
* [end-to-end testing](/notes/testing#end-to-end)

**It is generally much more expensive to remove a fault than to avoid a fault.**

### Fault Tolerance

In spite of the best efforts to avoid or remove them, there are bound to be faults in any operational system. A system built with fault tolerance capabilities will manage to keep operating, perhaps at a degraded level, in the presence of these faults. For a system to be [fault tolerant](/notes/fault-tolerance), it must be able to:

* detect
* diagnose
* confine
* mask
* compensate
* recover

### Fault Evasion

It is possible to observe the behavior of a system and use this information to take action to
compensate for faults before they occur. Often, systems exhibit a characteristic or normal behavior. When a system deviates from its normal behavior, even if the behavior continues to meet system specifications, it may be appropriate to reconfigure the system to reduce the stress on a component with a high failure potential. We have coined the term fault evasion to describe this practice. A [computer system](/notes/system) that suddenly begins to respond sluggishly often prompts a prudent user to backup any work in progress, even though overall system performance may be within specification.
