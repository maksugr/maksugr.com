A system is **dependable** when it is trustworthy enough that reliance can be placed on the service that it delivers. For a system to be dependable, it must be:

* [available](/notes/dependable-system-attributes-available) (ready for use when we need it)
* [reliable](/notes/dependable-system-attributes-reliable) (able to provide continuity of service while we are using it)
* [safe](/notes/dependable-system-attributes-safe) (does not have a catastrophic consequence on the environment)
* [secure](/notes/dependable-system-attributes-secure) (able to preserve confidentiality)

Although these system attributes can be considered in isolation, in fact they are **interdependent**. For instance, a system that is not reliable is also not available (at least when it is not operating correctly). A secure system that doesn't allow an authorized access is also not available. An unreliable system to control nuclear reactors is probably not a safe one either.
